Website to connect front-line health professionals dealing with COVID-19 with mental health service providers willing to donate their time.
Created using Bootstrap 4 because I wanted to put something together fast and was too lazy to create my own custom versions of just the bits of Bootstrap I actaully want and/or do the whole thing using a more complete tech stack that would probably be overkill for a relatively simple website like this.
